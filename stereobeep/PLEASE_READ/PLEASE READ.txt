Madam,

1. The Name of my website content folder is "stereobeep". Copy that entire folder in your Wampserver data file path. (Usually in the "www" subfolder in wamp64  main folder.
	[ Ex:-  C:// --> wamp64 --> www ]

2. The database name is "stereobeep.sql" . Import that DB into your phpmyadmin server. The Character set of the file is "utf-8" .

3. Open the website from your wampserver "stereobeep" folder. 

Thank you.
